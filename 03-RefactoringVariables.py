## This is an example on how you can change var values

# meal_Complete = True
# sub_total = 100
# tip = sub_total * 1/5
# total = sub_total + tip

# receipt = "Your total is " + str(total)

# print(receipt)

first = 'Springman'
second = 'Bregman'
third = 'Altuve'

print(first)

first = third 

print(first)
