Behind the scenes of the code test is a function called sequence that accepts 5 arguments: first, second, third, fourth, and fifth. Unfortunately, they are not in sequential order. Using named arguments, call the sequence function and pass in the 5 arguments, setting their values to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 respectively.
